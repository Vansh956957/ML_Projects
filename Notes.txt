Import Data, 
Split to train, test.
do feature engineeing.

1. Define the data types of each coloumns and divide them on the basis of that.
e.g. Categorical Data and continious data.
* Nominal
* Ordinal
* Interval
* Ratio

| Feature       | Nominal             | Ordinal                  |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Order exists? | ❌ No                | ✅ Yes                    |
| Examples      | Gender, City, Color | Ratings, Education level |
| Can you rank? | ❌                   | ✅                        |



| Feature                        | Ordinal                  | Interval          |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| Has order?                     | ✅                        | ✅                 |
| Equal distance between values? | ❌                        | ✅                 |
| Can do arithmetic?             | ❌                        | ✅                 |
| Example                        | Rating scale (1–5 stars) | Temperature in °C |

2. For Numerical distrubution instead of visualizing in set, as can be done in case of categorical.
   visualize in terms of single Featue at a time.
   
   e.g. Independent Variable (Numerical)
    There are 4 features that are Numerical: These features have numerical values :
    (ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, LoanAmount, Loan_Amount_Term)
    Firstly, let’s look at the Applicant income distribution:

3. Try to relate from the plot what can be noticed, like if there is a dispairity in plot of income range that 
   may be due to some reason. if you cant predict actual reason try to figure out using other columns available 
   and try to link them. like education level may differ the salary, try to plot them both side by side to comapare
   as dependent graph.
